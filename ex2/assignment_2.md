# A SF Permits Cleaning
_4 points_

- Download the [Building_Permits.csv from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aparnashastry/building-permit-applications-data)
- Clean the San Francisco Building permit dataset
- Use imputation were necessary

# B SF Permits Exploration
_6 points_

- Explore the data. Which columns correlate strongly with the "Current Status" column? How do other columns correlate to each other? 
- Describe problems with "Current Status" as a target column to predict. Can you construct a better target column?

# C SF Permits Prediction
_6 points_
- Predict the "Current Status" or your substitute column from B from the other columns.
- Drop unessecary columns
- Construct one-hot encoded dummy columns
- Choose the Predictor of your choice

# D SF Challenges
_4 points_
Describe challenges you faced during  A, B and C and how you solved it.

# E Neural Networks XOR
_5 points_
We described a neural network that represents an XOR gate in class. 

- Write down a function, that consists of all modular parts of that network. Use the functions of AND, OR and NOT and stitch it together. 
- Use explicit weights, for example the ones we used in class.

# F Neural Networks Overfitting

_6 points_

- Train a neural net and overfit it to cifar. 
- Don't use any regularization. 
- Don't use my crappy implementation, but use keras. Use the train and test splits in the data do evaluate the model.


# G Neural Networks Overfitting
_6 points_

- Train a neural net and prevent overfitting by regularization. 
- You can use any combination of regularizers we saw in class.
- Use the train and test splits in the data do evaluate the model.
